# Horny Diabetic Shark Gaiden

This is a TIC-80 game I made with [Navidon1147](https://github.com/navidon1147) in ~1 week for BotB's [Game Jam #05](https://battleofthebits.com/arena/Battle/8729). We used Visual Studio Code, Aseprite, Krita, Furnace, and FL Studio. This repository holds a lot of unused ideas and the code absolutely needs a facelift, so we may revisit this thing in the future.

You play as a shark jumping to the beat around a layered maze while collecting keys and avoiding death traps. There's only two levels and three songs (the first of which was done by nav). You can move in four directions using the d-pad or arrow keys and that's it. Fall through the hole on each layer and you winner!
